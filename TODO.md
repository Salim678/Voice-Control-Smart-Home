## üîÑ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Hardware Setup
- [ ] Upload Arduino code to your board using Arduino IDE
- [ ] Connect Bluetooth module to Arduino
- [ ] Wire relay module to Arduino pins
- [ ] Connect your appliances to relay modules
- [ ] Pair Bluetooth module with your computer
- [ ] Update `backend/server.js` with correct COM port

### 2. Software Installation
